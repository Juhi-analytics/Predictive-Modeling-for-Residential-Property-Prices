# Predictive-Modeling-for-Residential-Property-Prices

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts properties prices using property features such as location, total square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHK configuration. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment using Streamlit.

📌 Problem Statement Accurate house price estimation is critical for buyers, sellers, and real estate platforms. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting property prices based on key property attributes.

📂 Dataset Overview 📊 13,000+ property records 📍 Multiple locations 🏠 Residential property data

Feature	Description
location	Area of property
total_sqft	Total square footage
bath	Number of bathrooms
bhk	Number of bedrooms
price	Target variable (in Lakhs)
🧹 Data Preprocessing ✔ Data Cleaning Removed duplicate records Handled missing values Removed invalid sqft entries Treated extreme outliers

✔ Feature Engineering Created a new feature: df["price_per_sqft"] = (df["price"] * 100000) / df["total_sqft"] 🔹 Why? To normalize pricing across properties and detect abnormal valuations.

Handled Outliers Handling outliers in total_sqft Note: here there are some houses with less than 300 sqft (ouliers) formula: total_sqft/bhk >=300 #to keep only realistic rows handling outliers in BHK Handling outliers in bath column Realistic ---> no.of.bath<bhk+2 1bhk ---> 2 2bhk ---> 3 3bhk ---> 5

unrealistic 1bhk ---> 4 bath 2bhk ---> 5 bath

bath<bhk+2 to keep realistic bath counts Handling outliers in price per sqft IQR method --->outlier handling method
